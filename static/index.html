  <h1>What is Actix</h1>

    <article>
      <h2>Actix</h2>
      <p>Actix is a high-performance, asynchronous, and actor-based framework for building web applications and services
        using the Rust programming language.</p>
      <p>It provides developers with tools to create efficient and concurrent applications while leveraging Rust's
        safety and performance benefits.</p>
      <aside>
        <h3>What is Rust</h3>
        <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and
          concurrency.</p>
        <p>It enforces memory safety—ensuring that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a
          garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.</p>
      </aside>
      <h2>concepts of Actix</h2>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <b>Asynchronous Programming:</b>
          <p>Actix is built around asynchronous programming, which allows applications to efficiently handle multiple
            tasks without being blocked by I/O operations.</p>
          <p>This leads to better utilization of system resources and improved scalability.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Actor Model:</b>
          <p>Actix employs the actor model, which is a conceptual framework for building concurrent and distributed
            systems.</p>
          <p>In Actix, actors are isolated units of computation that can send messages to each other, helping to
            organize and simplify complex application logic.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>HTTP Handling:</b>
          <p>Actix provides a powerful and flexible way to handle HTTP requests and responses.</p>
          <p>It allows developers to define routes, middleware, and request handlers using a clean and ergonomic syntax.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Websockets:</b>
          <p>Actix supports WebSockets, enabling real-time bidirectional communication between clients and servers.</p>
          </p>This is particularly useful for applications that require instant updates or interactions, such as chat
          applications or real-time data visualization.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Middleware:</b>
          <p>Middleware in Actix allows developers to insert logic that runs before or after processing requests.</p>
          <p>This can include tasks like authentication, logging, compression, and more.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Error Handling:</b>
          <p>Actix encourages robust error handling through Rust's strong type system.</p>
          <p>It provides mechanisms for handling errors and propagating them through the application in a safe and
            manageable manner.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <b>Testing:</b>
          <p>Actix provides testing utilities that make it easier to write unit tests and integration tests for your
            application.</p>
          <p>This ensures that your code remains reliable and behaves as expected.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <b>Extensibility:</b>
          <p>Actix's design is modular and extensible, allowing developers to integrate third-party libraries,
            components, and data stores as needed.</p>
        </ul>
